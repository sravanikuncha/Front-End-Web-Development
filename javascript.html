<!-- You're right, JavaScript typically executes line by line. However, in HTML, there's an interesting interplay between how the browser parses the code and how JavaScript executes. Here's why "Hello" appears first:

HTML Parsing: The browser encounters the HTML code first. It understands the <body> tag and starts building the page structure. It sees the <h1> tag and creates a heading element in memory, but doesn't display it yet.
Script Encountered: Next, the browser encounters the <script> tag.  Since script tags contain executable code, the browser pauses HTML parsing and hands over control to the JavaScript engine.

JavaScript Execution: The JavaScript engine sees alert("Hello") and immediately displays the alert box with "Hello" because that's its primary function â€“ to interrupt and display the message.
Back to HTML Parsing: Once the JavaScript finishes executing the alert statement, control returns to the browser's HTML parser.

Finishing the Page: Now, the browser resumes parsing the remaining HTML. It encounters the </h1> tag again and finally displays the "Heading one" text on the page.

So, even though JavaScript executes line by line, the browser prioritizes parsing critical HTML structure first. Script execution interrupts this parsing only temporarily.

Here's an additional point:

By default, script placement in the <head> section can sometimes delay rendering content until the script finishes execution. In your case, since the script is in the <body>, the delay is minimal. -->
